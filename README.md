An app designed to help you stay organized when packing for upcoming trips.  
Select a category from the drop down menu and then add which ever items you don't want to forget!  
If you're like me and like to check items off your list as you place them in your suitcase (an exta step if youre extra paranoid you might forget something), use the checkbox feature beside each item.
